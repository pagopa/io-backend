# Digital citizenship web and mobile backend

This repository contains the code of the backend used by the [web](https://github.com/teamdigitale/italia-web) and
[mobile](https://github.com/teamdigitale/italia-app) applications of the Digital citizenship project.

## How to run the application

### Dependencies

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)

To fully simulate the SPID authentication process we use the images provided by
[spid-testenv-backoffice](https://github.com/italia/spid-testenv-backoffice) and
[spid-testenv-identityserver](https://github.com/italia/spid-testenv-identityserver) projects.

A Linux/macOS environment is required at the moment.

### Steps

1. clone the project in a folder called italia-backend
2. go to the project's folder
3. run `scripts/yarn.sh` to install backend dependencies
4. run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers
5. edit your `/etc/hosts` file by adding:

```
localhost    spid-testenv-identityserver
localhost    italia-backend
```

6. wait a couple of minutes to let the IDP start (or monitor the process in `logs/idp/wso2carbon.log`)
7. run `scripts/import-spid-data.sh` to configure the local IDP 
8. point your browser to [https://italia-backend](https://italia-backend)

If you are using Docker with a Docker Machine replace `localhost with the IP of the Docker Machine
([More details here](https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/ip/)).

### Container description

* `backend`: the backend Node application that serves the web and mobile applications
* `shibboleth`: contains the Nginx server and a Shibboleth instance to perform SPID authentication
* `spid-testenv-identityserver`: the test IDP server
* `spid-testenv-backoffice`: simple configuration interface to manage the test IDP server

Nginx is reachable at [https://italia-backend:80]() \
IDP is reachable at [https://spid-testenv-identityserver:9443]() (user: `admin`, password: `admin`) \
IDP simple backoffice is reachable at [https://spid-testenv-identityserver:8080]()
 
### Logs

Application logs are saved into the logs folder divided by logs generated by the spid-testenv-identityserver
container (`logs/idp`) and by the shibboleth container (`logs/shibboleth`).

### SPID user management

The setup procedure adds some test users to the test IDP server, the full list could be retrieved in
`spid-batch-import/spid-users.json`. To add more users connect to [https://spid-testenv-identityserver:8080]() and
navigate to: *service provider > Servizi registrati* and click on *Utenti*.
