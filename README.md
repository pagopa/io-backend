## What is this?

This is the backend that supports the [italia-app](https://github.com/teamdigitale/italia-app)
mobile application.

This project is part of the Italian Digital Citizenship initiative, see the
[main repository](https://github.com/teamdigitale/digital-citizenship) for further information.

## Authentication process

The `italia-app` application will authenticate to the backend in two steps:

  1. an initial user initiated SPID authentication process (SAML2 based)
     that identifies the user and, on success, triggers the creation of a new
     authentication session (associated to a session token)
  2. subsequent requests to the backend will be authenticated via a bearer session token

![authentication_process](doc/images/authentication_process.svg)

### User authentication

When a client (the mobile app or a browser) wants to login with the backend it will call the `/login` endpoint with the
IDP entityID as parameter in the query string. The backend will then builds an authorization URL and performs a redirect
to the chosen IDP. The authentication process will continue to the IDP website. If the authentication process ends with
success the IDP will redirect the client to an HTML page with a form that will auto-post itself to the
`/assertionConsumerService` endpoint with a SAMLResponse as an hidden field. The backend will parse and validate the
SAMLResponse to extract all the user attributes (fiscal code, first name, last name, email), then it will generates an
unique alphanumeric string as token and saves an User object to the `SessionStorage` service using the token as key.
Finally the backend will redirect the client to the value of the environment variable `CLIENT_REDIRECTION_URL` with the
token in the query string. The client must saves the token and use it in all API request.

The code that manage this flow are in the `spid-passport` package (more info
[here](https://github.com/italia/spid-passport)), and in the `src/strategies/spidStrategy.ts` and
`src/controllers/authenticationController.ts` files.

### Token authentication

All API requests sent by the client to the backend must have an `Authorization: Bearer` header with the value of the
token obtained from the SPID authentication process. The token is used to retrieve the User object from the
`SessionStorage` service.

The code that manage this flow are in the `src/strategies/bearerSessionTokenStrategy.ts` file.

## How to run the application

### Dependencies

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)

To fully simulate the SPID authentication process we use the images provided by
[spid-testenv-backoffice](https://github.com/italia/spid-testenv-backoffice) and
[spid-testenv-identityserver](https://github.com/italia/spid-testenv-identityserver) projects.

A Linux/macOS environment is required at the moment.

### Installation steps

1. clone the project in a folder called `italia-backend`
2. go to the project's folder
3. run `scripts/build-tools.sh` to build the `tools` Docker image
4. run `scripts/yarn.sh` to install backend dependencies
5. run `scripts/generate-proxy-api-models.sh` to generate the models defined in api_proxy.yaml and api_notifications.yaml
6. run `scripts/generate-api-client.sh` to generate the Autorest API Client
7. run `scripts/build.sh` to compile the Typescript files
8. run `scripts/generate-test-certs-task.sh` to create SAML (SPID) certificates
9. run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers
10. edit your `/etc/hosts` file by adding:

    ```
    localhost    spid-testenv-identityserver
    localhost    italia-backend
    ```

11. wait a couple of minutes to let the IDP start (or monitor the process with `$ tail -f logs/idp/wso2carbon.log`)
12. run `scripts/import-spid-data.sh` to configure the local IDP
13. copy `app/.env.example` to `app/.env` and fill the variables with your values
14. point your browser to [https://italia-backend](https://italia-backend)

If you are using Docker with a Docker Machine replace `localhost` with the IP of the Docker Machine
([More details here](https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/ip/)).

### Logs

Application logs are saved into the logs folder.

### SPID user management

The setup procedure adds some test users to the test IDP server, the full list could be retrieved in
`spid-batch-import/spid-users.json`. To add more users connect to [https://spid-testenv-identityserver:8080]() and
navigate to: *service provider > Servizi registrati* and click on *Utenti*.

## How to contribute

### Dependencies

* [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)
* [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) (optional)

A Linux/macOS environment is required at the moment.

### Starting steps

* use `nodenv` to run the correct version of Nodejs as specified in `app/.node-version`
* run Jest tests directly or with `scripts/test.sh`

In general follow the [Node Best Practices](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-best-practices).

### Generate the API client

The API client is generated with the [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) tool, in case of API change you need
to regenerate the client code:

* run the command `yarn generate:api-client`

### Generate SAML (SPID) certs

The backend implements a SAML Service Provider - for authenticating the clients
it needs a certificate that you can generate with the following command
(you need to have `openssl` available in your path):

```
$ yarn generate:test-certs
```

### Architecture decision records

In a world of evolutionary architecture, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future
team members as well as for external oversight. Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important
architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We store these details in source control, along with
code, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself.

We use
[ADR](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)s to track architectural decisions of
this initiative.

This repository is configured for Nat Pryce's [_adr-tools_](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

Here's the decisions we taken so far:

| ADR | Title                                                                                                                             | PR (discussion)    |

## Troubleshooting

**I installed on my mac but seems that https://italia-backend:80 is not working (ping italia-backend return a host error)**

Check out /etc/hosts
Remember that in some cases you need to use your docker-machine ip (get it from >docker-machine ip) instead of
localhost.

**I followed all the steps but when i go to https://italia-backend it shows me the same as https://italia-backend:8080**

This problem seems to be dependent on how Docker for Mac (doesn't) manage well the /etc/hosts file. If you install
Docker Toolbox it works fine (and can [coexist](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/#setting-up-to-run-docker-for-mac))
(Read more at [https://medium.com/@itseranga/set-hosts-in-docker-for-mac-2029276fd448](https://medium.com/@itseranga/set-hosts-in-docker-for-mac-2029276fd448))

**When i run the scripts/import-spid-data.sh file, after the first entries the script display a lot of errors like
`# users imported: -- Error [object Object]`**

Have you waited the IDP to start successfully? Wait a minute and retry.
