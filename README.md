# Digital citizenship web and mobile backend

This repository contains the code of the backend used by the [web](https://github.com/teamdigitale/italia-web) and
[mobile](https://github.com/teamdigitale/italia-app) applications of the Digital citizenship project.

## How to run the application

### Dependencies

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)

To fully simulate the SPID authentication process we use the images provided by
[spid-testenv-backoffice](https://github.com/italia/spid-testenv-backoffice) and
[spid-testenv-identityserver](https://github.com/italia/spid-testenv-identityserver) projects.

A Linux/macOS environment is required at the moment.

### Installation steps

1. clone the project in a folder called `italia-backend`
2. go to the project's folder
3. run `scripts/yarn.sh` to install backend dependencies
4. run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers
5. edit your `/etc/hosts` file by adding:

```
localhost    spid-testenv-identityserver
localhost    italia-backend
```

6. wait a couple of minutes to let the IDP start (or monitor the process with `$ tail -f logs/idp/wso2carbon.log`)
7. run `scripts/import-spid-data.sh` to configure the local IDP
8. copy `app/.env.example` to `app/.env` and fill the variables with your values
9. point your browser to [https://italia-backend](https://italia-backend)

If you are using Docker with a Docker Machine replace `localhost` with the IP of the Docker Machine
([More details here](https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/ip/)).

### Container description

* `backend`: the backend Node application that serves the web and mobile applications
* `shibboleth`: contains the Nginx server and a Shibboleth instance to perform SPID authentication
* `spid-testenv-identityserver`: the test IDP server
* `spid-testenv-backoffice`: simple configuration interface to manage the test IDP server

Nginx is reachable at [https://italia-backend:80]() \
IDP is reachable at [https://spid-testenv-identityserver:9443]() (user: `admin`, password: `admin`) \
IDP simple backoffice is reachable at [https://spid-testenv-identityserver:8080]()

### Logs

Application logs are saved into the logs folder divided by logs generated by the spid-testenv-identityserver
container (`logs/idp`) and by the shibboleth container (`logs/shibboleth`).

### SPID user management

The setup procedure adds some test users to the test IDP server, the full list could be retrieved in
`spid-batch-import/spid-users.json`. To add more users connect to [https://spid-testenv-identityserver:8080]() and
navigate to: *service provider > Servizi registrati* and click on *Utenti*.

## How to contribute

### Dependencies

* [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)
* [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [flow](https://flow.org) and [flow-typed](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/blob/master/README.md)

A Linux/macOS environment is required at the moment.

### Starting steps

* use `nodenv` to run the correct version of Nodejs as specified in `app/.node-version`
* configure your IDE to use flow and ESLint
* run Jest tests directly or with `scripts/test.sh`

In general follow the [Node Best Practices](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-best-practices).

### Generate the API client

The API client is generated with the [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) tool, in case of API change you need
to regenerate the client code:

* download the latest API specs from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teamdigitale/digital-citizenship-functions/master/api/public_api_v1.yaml]
* install the [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) tool
* run the command `autorest --input-file=public_api_v1.yaml --nodejs --output-folder=app/src/api`

## Troubleshooting

**I installed on my mac but seems that https://italia-backend:80 is not working (ping italia-backend return a host error)**

Check out /etc/hosts
Remember that in some cases you need to use your docker-machine ip (get it from >docker-machine ip) instead of
localhost.

**I followed all the steps but when i go to https://italia-backend it shows me the same as https://italia-backend:8080**

This problem seems to be dependent on how Docker for Mac (doesn't) manage well the /etc/hosts file. If you install
Docker Toolbox it works fine (and can [coexist](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/#setting-up-to-run-docker-for-mac))
(Read more at [https://medium.com/@itseranga/set-hosts-in-docker-for-mac-2029276fd448](https://medium.com/@itseranga/set-hosts-in-docker-for-mac-2029276fd448))  

**When i run the scripts/import-spid-data.sh file, after the first entries the script display a lot of errors like
`# users imported: -- Error [object Object]`**

Have you waited the IDP to start successfully? Wait a minute and retry.
