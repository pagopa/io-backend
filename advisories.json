    "overview": "st is a module for serving static files.\n\nAn attacker is able to craft a request that results in an `HTTP 301` (redirect) to an entirely different domain. \n\nA request for: `http://some.server.com//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e` would result in a 301 to `//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e` which most browsers treat as a proper redirect as `//` is translated into the current schema being used.\n\nMitigating factor: \n\nIn order for this to work, `st` must be serving from the root of a server (`/`) rather than the typical sub directory (`/static/`) and the redirect URL will end with some form of URL encoded `..` (\"%2e%2e\", \"%2e.\", \".%2e\"). \n\nCode example (provided by Xin Gao): \n\n[example.js]\n\n```\nvar st = require('st') \nvar http = require('http') \nhttp.createServer(st(process.cwd())).listen(1337)\n```\n\n```\n$ curl -v http://localhost:1337//cve.mitre.com/%2e%2e\n*   Trying ::1...\n* TCP_NODELAY set\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 1337 (#0)\n> GET //cve.mitre.com/%2e%2e HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:1337\n> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0\n> Accept: */*\n>\n< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\n< cache-control: public, max-age=600\n< last-modified: Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:56:33 GMT\n< etag: \"16777220-46488904-1507935393000\"\n< location: //cve.mitre.com/%2e%2e/\n< Date: Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:56:41 GMT\n< Connection: keep-alive\n< Content-Length: 30\n<\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n```",

This makes http-signature vulnerable to header forgery. \n\nThus, if an attacker can intercept a request, he can swap header names and change the meaning of the request without changing the signature. \n\n\nFor this example request: \n```\nPOST /pay HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nDate: Thu, 05 Jan 2012 21:31:40 GMT\nX-Payment-Source: src@money.com\nX-Payment-Destination: dst@money.com\nAuthorization: Signature keyId=\"Test\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",headers=\"x-payment-source x-payment-destination\" MDyO5tSvin5...\n```\nThe request can be changed to have the following:\n```\nX-Payment-Source: dst@money.com // Emails switched\nX-Payment-Destination: src@money.com\nAuthorization: Signature keyId=\"Test\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\",headers=\"x-payment-destination x-payment-source\" MDyO5tSvin5...\n```\nand both would be signed:\n```\nsrc@money.com\\n\ndst@money.com\\n\n```\n(Fuller explanation of this example on the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/issues/10))",

    "overview": "Sails is an MVC style framework for building realtime web applications.\n\nVersion 0.12.6 and lower have an issue with the CORS configuration where the value of the origin header is reflected as the value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.  This would allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable hosts through cross site scripting or a malicious HTML Document, effectively bypassing the Same Origin Policy. Note that this is only an issue when `allRoutes` is set to `true` and `origin` is set to `*` or left commented out in the sails CORS config file.  The problem can be compounded when the cors `credentials` setting is not provided.  At that point authenticated cross domain requests are possible.",
    "recommendation": "When using Sails make sure to double check your CORS configuration.  using `allRoutes: true` with `origin:'*'` will enable the vulnerable behavior, as will failing to uncomment out `origin` and setting it to a reasonable value.  Ensure that if `origin` is set to `*` that you truly mean for all other websites to be able to make cross-domain requests to your API.\n\nLikewise, ensure `credentials` is uncommented out and set to the appropriate value. Make sure to explicitly set which origins may request resources via CORS.\n\nA misconfiguration in a production environment will result in a error message being written to the node process console upon application start in versions 0.12.7 and higher of sails.",

In versions prior to 3.0.0, verification of the token could be bypassed when the `alg` field is set to `none`.\n\n*Edit ( 7/29/16 ): A previous version of this advisory incorrectly stated that the vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.0 instead of 3.0.0.

If an application is escaping command-line args with this module, they might be vulnerable from malicious user input.\n\nFor example:\n```\nvar sq = require('../tests/get/shell-quote-1.6.0');\nvar exec = require('child_process').exec;\n\nvar pattern = process.argv[2];\n\ncommand = sq.quote(['grep', pattern]));\nexec('cat file | ' + command, function ( err, stdout, stderr) {\n    console.log(command, stdout);   \n});\n```\nwill be vulnerable when user input something like pattern = ':</etc/passwd', which causes the content of /etc/passwd to be leaked.\n\nInternally, (Jon Lamendola, Nick Starke, Jacob Waddell) found that the `;`, `{`, and `}` characters weren't escaped properly either. This allows for full command injection. A malicious user could input `'a;{echo,test,123,234}'` to execute echo fully.",

Due to a design flaw in the CLI, these bearer tokens were sent with every request made by the CLI for logged-in users, regardless of the destination of the request. They should instead only be included for requests made against the registry or registries used for the current install.\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker to set up an HTTP server that could collect authentication information they could use to impersonate the users whose tokens they collected. This impersonation would allow them to do anything the compromised users could do, including publishing new versions of packages.",

Any modern kernel will zero out new memory pages before handing them off to a process. This means that only memory previously used and deallocated by the node process can be leaked.\n1. Node.js manages Buffers by creating a few large internal SlowBuffers, and slicing them up into smaller Buffers which are made accessible in JS. They are not stored on V8's heap, because garbage collection would interfere. The result is that only memory that has been previously allocated as a Buffer can be leaked.",

The client (which could in fact be the server in certain instances) is that one that allocates and sends the memory that is then echo'd by the server.\n\nA vulnerability was found in the ping functionality of the ws module which allowed clients to allocate memory by sending a ping frame. The ping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previously given payload of the ping frame. \n\nThis is exactly what you expect, but internally ws always transforms all data that we need to send to a Buffer instance and that is where the vulnerability existed. ws didn't do any checks for the type of data it was sending. With buffers in node when you allocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.\n\n```\nvar x = new Buffer(100);\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100');\n```\n\nThis would allocate 100 bytes of memory in the first example and just 3 bytes with 100 as value in the second example. So the client would allocate 100 bytes of non-zeroed buffer and send that to the server. \n\n\n\n## Example POC\n```\nvar ws = require('ws')\n\nvar server = new ws.Server({ port: 9000 })\nvar client = new ws('ws://localhost:9000')\n\nclient.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('open')\n  client.ping(50) // this sends a non-zeroed buffer of 50 bytes\n\n  client.on('pong', function (data) {\n    console.log('got pong')\n    console.log(data) // Data from the client. \n  })\n})\n```",

This bug was [demonstrated](https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/backdooring-js/) by [Yan](https://twitter.com/bcrypt) to allow potentially malicious code to be hidden within secure code, activated by minification.\n\n\n### Details:\n\nIn Boolean algebra, DeMorgan's laws describe the relationships between conjunctions ( && ), disjunctions ( || ) and negations ( ! ).\nIn Javascript form, they state that:\n !(a && b) === (!a) || (!b)\n !(a || b) === (!a) && (!b)\n\nThe law does not hold true when one of the values is not a boolean however.\n\nVulnerable versions of UglifyJS do not account for this restriction, and erroneously apply the laws to a statement if it can be reduced in length by it.\n\nConsider this authentication function:\n\n```\nfunction isTokenValid(user) {\n    var timeLeft =\n        !!config && // config object exists\n        !!user.token && // user object has a token\n        !user.token.invalidated && // token is not explicitly invalidated\n        !config.uninitialized && // config is initialized\n        !config.ignoreTimestamps && // don't ignore timestamps\n        getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry); // > 0 if expiration is in the future\n\n    // The token must not be expired\n    return timeLeft > 0;\n}\n\nfunction getTimeLeft(expiry) {\n  return expiry - getSystemTime();\n}\n```\nWhen minified with a vulnerable version of UglifyJS, it will produce the following insecure output, where a token will never expire:\n\n( Formatted for readability )\n\n```\nfunction isTokenValid(user) {\n    var timeLeft = !(                       // negation\n        !config                             // config object does not exist\n        || !user.token                      // user object does not have a token\n        || user.token.invalidated           // token is explicitly invalidated\n        || config.uninitialized             // config isn't initialized\n        || config.ignoreTimestamps          // ignore timestamps\n        || !getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry)  // > 0 if expiration is in the future\n    );\n    return timeLeft > 0\n}\n\nfunction getTimeLeft(expiry) {\n    return expiry - getSystemTime()\n}\n```",

    "overview": "Connect is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.\n\nThe \"methodOverride\" middleware allows the http post to override the method of the request with the value of the \"_method\" post key or with the header \"x-http-method-override\".\n\nBecause the user post input was not checked, req.method could contain any kind of value. Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect answered with a 404 page containing the \"Cannot [method] [url]\" content. The method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.\n\n\n###Example:\n```\n~ curl \"localhost:3000\" -d \"_method=<script src=http://nodesecurity.io/xss.js></script>\"\nCannot <SCRIPT SRC=HTTP://NODESECURITY.IO/XSS.JS></SCRIPT> /\n```\n\n###Credit:\n[Sergio Arcos](https://twitter.com/martes_trece)\n\n###History\n(2013-06-27) Bug reported:\nhttps://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/831\n\n(2013-06-27) First fix: escape req.method output\nhttps://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/277e5aad6a95d00f55571a9a0e11f2fa190d8135\n\n(2013-06-27) Second fix: whitelist\nhttps://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/126187c4e12162e231b87350740045e5bb06e93a",

    "slug": "js-yaml_deserialization-code-execution",
    "overview": "The JS-YAML module for Node.js contained a code execution vulnerability prior to version 2.0.5. The maintainers of JS-YAML have patched this vulnerability and, beginning in version 2.1.0, have provided a safeLoad method for parsing YAML. Developers that use this module should make sure they have upgraded and should strongly consider porting their code to use the new safeLoad method.\n\n### Details\nThe module allowed code execution due to a custom data-type that it defined and parsed called !!js/function. The way it would parse the data was to create a new Function object in JavaScript based on the input, which is equivalent to calling eval on the input:\n\n```\nfunction resolveJavascriptFunction(object /*, explicit*/) {\n  /*jslint evil:true*/\n  var func;\n\n  try {\n    func = new Function('return ' + object);\n    return func();\n  } catch (error) {\n    return NIL;\n  }\n}\n```\nThat meant the code snippet below, when run, would execute code instead of simply defining a function:\n\n```\nvar yaml = require('js-yaml');\n\nx = \"test: !!js/function > \\n  \\\nfunction f() { \\n    \\\nconsole.log(1); \\n  \\\n}();\"\n\nyaml.load(x);\n```",
    "recommendation": "Developers using the JS-YAML module should make sure that they are working with an up-to-date version and should strongly consider porting their code to use safeLoad in place of load, especially when accepting YAML derived from user input.",

    "overview": "Tomato is a Node.js web framework.\n\nThe tomato API has an admin service that is enabled by setting up an access_key in the config options. This access_key is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.\n\nThe key is checked by checking to see if the access_key provided in the request is within the configured access_key string, not equal to. So a single character that's within the access key is sufficient to bypass this control.\n\n### Example:\nThis is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.\n\n```\nif (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {\n```\n\nFor an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8081/api/exec\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @test -H \"access-key: a\"\n{\n \"cmd\": \"ls\",\n \"path\": \".\",\n \"stdout\": \"app.js\\nconfig.js\\nlog\\nnode_modules\\nserver.js\\n\",\n \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### Mitigating factors:\n\nThe admin interface is disabled by default. The module author confirmed that the access_key should really be an array of access_keys, however based on variable name and documentation it was not clear that it should be an array. The vulnerability exists only if a string access_key is set.\n\nModule version 0.0.6 has been updated to ensure an array of keys is provided as well as documentation updates.",
